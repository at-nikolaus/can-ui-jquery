# can-ui-jquery
Is A Compatiblity Version of can-ui using jquery it allows you to use jquery plugins more easy as it converts them to can-ui elements

## Why?
Because CanJS via View already handles Selection of HTML elements so jquery is not needed
- UI Interactions on a can handled element are a ideal binding for ui events
- We want to use stuff like jquery datepicker the steal module way
